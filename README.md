## Description

My motivation to build this project was to create an application to make it easy for employers to track and/or list their employees. This application speeds up the process of being able to list your employees, their jobs and information. The biggest thing I learned from this project was how to use constructors in javascript and utilize node to list each item out. 

## Installation 

To install this application you will need to download virtual studio code or another code editor, setup your ssh keys, and copy the git repo into your local machine.

## Usage

After you copy the repo into your machine, you will want to make sure you have node.js downloaded and installed as well. After that you open your integrated terminal in your code editor and run node index.js to run the application. Below is a video example:
